# Network Intrusion Detection
This project is a network intrusion detector, a predictive model built to distinguish between bad connections (intrusions/attacks) and good (normal) connections. The dataset used is KDD Cup 1999 dataset and various machine learning algorithms have been used to train the model. The UI has been developed using flask framework.
